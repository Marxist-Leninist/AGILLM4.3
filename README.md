# AGILLM 4.3 — Autoregressive + DiffusionBlock + MoE Language Model

**Single-file implementation:** `agillm41.py`
**Parameters:** 1.22B (1,221,580,802)
**Architecture:** d_model=1280, layers=28, heads=20, d_k=64, rank=160 (2.5× expansion), tied weights

## ⚠️ CHECKPOINT PROVENANCE — READ FIRST

Checkpoint filenames (e.g. `pretrain_step00050650.pt`) reflect the **step counter within the current training run**, NOT total training steps.

**This model warm-started from step 2,182,564 (~2.1M steps) of a prior run.**

| What the filename says | What it actually means |
|---|---|
| `pretrain_step00050650.pt` | Current-run step 50,650 |
| True total steps | ≈ 2,182,564 + 50,650 = **~2,233,214 steps** |
| Tokens seen (current run) | ~4.2B / 67.2B target (6.25%) |

Checkpoints live in:
```
checkpoints/warmstart_step2182564__current_step50650/
```
The folder name is the canonical reference for provenance.

## Inference

```bash
# AR mode (standard autoregressive)
python3 agillm41.py infer \
  --ckpt checkpoints/warmstart_step2182564__current_step50650/pretrain_step00050650.pt \
  --prompt "Your prompt here" \
  --mode ar --max_new 100 --plain-output --block_stream

# SAT mode (score-and-threshold diffusion)
python3 agillm41.py infer ... --mode sat

# NAT mode (non-autoregressive diffusion)
python3 agillm41.py infer ... --mode nat
```

> **Note:** If both GPUs are busy with training, add `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""` to force CPU inference (slow but functional: ~1.2 tok/s).

> **Dependency:** `agillm_checkpoint_provenance.py` must be in the same directory as `agillm41.py`.

## Current Inference Quality (step ~50,650 / ~2.23M total)

See `INFERENCE_QUALITY.md` for AR/SAT/NAT benchmark outputs at each major checkpoint.

At this training stage (6.25% of token target), output is partially coherent — the model knows structure, names, dates, and grammar patterns but has not yet converged on fluent generation. Expect significant quality improvement as training approaches 67B tokens.

## Inference Benchmarks

The following benchmarks demonstrate the inference speed across Autoregressive (AR), Semi-Autoregressive (SAT), and Non-Autoregressive (NAT) generation modes on a 128-token sequence. 

**Hardware Specifications:** CPU x16 (Fair run)
**Load Baseline:** 67.4s

| Mode       | Generation Time | Speed (tok/s) |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| AR-128     | 28.1s           | 4.56          |
| SAT-128    | 16.7s           | 7.66          |
| NAT p4-128 | 5.1s            | 25.10         |
| NAT p2-128 | 1.5s            | 85.33         |
| NAT p1-128 | 1.8s            | 71.11         |

*Note: The token-per-second metrics are highly dependent on the specified hardware specs (CPU x16) and will vary significantly on other hardware (e.g., GPU acceleration).*
